#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing code, I focus on keeping things modular and clean—like . During the CRUD Python module for Project One, I separated functionality into clear functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. This made connecting the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two a breeze. The biggest advantage help was when changes were needed, I only had to tweak specific functions. I could definitely reuse this CRUD module in future projects, whether it's integrating a new dashboard or building a completely different application.

#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems by breaking down the problem, and then mapping out a plan. For Grazioso Salvare, I took a methodical approach to the database and dashboard requirements, which felt a bit different from previous assignments where I might have jumped straight into coding. I focused more on planning and aligning my work with real-world needs. In the future, I'll keep using this strategy and taking a step back to think through client needs before writing a single line of code.

#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are like digital architects, we build systems that solve real-world problems. My work on this project helped Grazioso Salvare streamline their processes, making it easier for them to manage data and focus on their mission. Whether it's saving animals or boosting business efficiency, good software can make a real difference—and that's why this work matters.
